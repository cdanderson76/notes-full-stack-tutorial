CHALLENGE:

1.  Create a folder on the desktop.  Open it up in VSCode, and then start the Vite app, creating a folder called 'frontend'.

    Within the 'src' directory, create the following folders:
    
    components
    pages (Create subfolers 'Home', 'Login', 'SignUp');
    utils

2. Create functions that render their respected names within each subfolder of the 'pages' folder.  Ensure that they are
   exported.  Render the 'Home' component to the page.

5. Install 'react-router-dom' in the 'frontend' directory.  Check and make sure that the it was installed inside of the 
   'package.json' file when finished

6. Create routes for the different pages as follows:

   Home = '/dashboard'
   Login = '/login'
   SignUp = '/signup'

   Now, when you go to each URL path, you should see the content of each page.
